1. Write the hello world program using html file

2. Write the hello world using javascript

3. Write the same code using the react 

-> we have configure the react to our project so it can use the react 
-> we are using cdn of react to the project
-> 1st src is for the core react use
-> 2nd src is for dom operation (or) dom manipulation

-> react can only works on browser it can also be use in mobile application throught 
the react native , there is something called react 3d also

-> think about react-dom is like the bridge between your browser and react


-> by adding both script we are able to access the React and ReactDom objects

-> by using this both the object we can use the superpower now


-> React.createElement we have pass three agruments to it
  -> tag name
  -> {} the attribute that assign to the tags
  -> content of the tag


-> ReactDOM.createRoot(pass referneces of root)

-> root.render -> pass what you wanted to render inside the root
